# App Data Analysis with Power BI

## Features

- Dual-axis chart comparing average installs and revenue for free vs paid apps in top categories.
- Time series chart tracking total installs over time, segmented by app categories.

## Data
The dataset includes information such as app installs, revenue, app size, and content ratings. Filters are applied to focus on apps with more than 10,000 installs and revenue exceeding $10,000, among other conditions.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `.pbix` file in [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
3. Ensure the data files are correctly linked or update the file paths in Power BI.

## Usage Instructions
